THE BEER-WARE LICENSE (Revision 42)

Kaze (https://ko-fi.com/darkkaze) created this project. As long as you
retain this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we
meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a
beer (or a coffee) in return.

This license applies to the Waifu Librera project, including all
microservices (backend, speech_to_text_service, visemas_service,
animation_service) and the Vue frontend.

The Beerware license is a humorous license that gives you freedom to do
anything with the code while encouraging you to buy the author a drink
if you find it useful.
